## 📋 Migration Steps

If you're currently using a `.venv` and `requirements.txt`, follow these steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Activate your existing virtual environment
source ./.venv/bin/activate

# 2. Extract only the top-level dependencies
pip install pipreqs
pipreqs . --force


# Step 3: Deactivate and remove the old venv
deactivate
rm -rf .venv

# Step 4: Initialize a new uv environment
uv init

# Step 5: Install the dependencies using uv
uv add -r requirements.txt
